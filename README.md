# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day for a work schedule. Will allow users to plan from 9AM - 5PM. </br>
The user may enter in the text area just right of whatever time period they want to enter in an event for that time. </br>
Once they enter in the event in their selected timeblock they can select save so it wont go away if they were to close or refresh the webpage. 
They will also be presented with a message towards the top of the webpage that their event is saved in the local storage. </br>
The calendar also will display differently based on what time it is. If the current hour has passed then it will display gray. 
If the time is present then it will display red for the time block and if it is in the future the time block will display green. </br>
This calendar may be utilized for anyone with a busy day and needs a webpage to go to see what is up and coming or what has already passed.
