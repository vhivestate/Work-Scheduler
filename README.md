# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day for a work schedule. Will allow users to plan from 9AM - 5PM. </br>
This will be useful for anyone who likes to plan out their work day. When a user saves a task a message will appear letting them know that the task was saved to their local storage. Meaning, it will not disapear when the webpage is refreshed or website is closed. </br>
The calendar will display unique colors based on the time. If hour has passed the timeblock will be gray, if it's currently that time the timeblock will be red, and if it's a future hour the color will be green. </br>
